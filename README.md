# Wiki Web App

Welcome to the custom Wiki web app built using Django! This project allows users to create and search their own Wiki entries. The app is designed to be a simple and easy to use platform for creating and sharing knowledge. Features include:

Create, read, and update functionality for Wiki entries
Search functionality for looking up articles
Article display with sections, images and links using markdown -> HTML conversion

This project is a great example of how to use Django to create a full-featured web app with database management.
